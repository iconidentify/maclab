# Runs omarchy-m-test (github.com/maralcbr/omarchy-m-testing) inside the GUI
# user's desktop session and keeps its signed report. Installs or upgrades the
# tool first with its own installer, which checks the release signature.
#
# It runs unattended: one Enter accepts the disclaimer, and then input ends,
# so every question the tool asks a person (look at the screen, close the lid,
# reload the Wi-Fi driver, upload) is answered "skip" or "no", never "yes".
# --dry-run: it never uploads by itself; labd publishes known-good runs.
